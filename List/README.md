An implementation of dynamically managed linked lists. 
The creation (memory allocation), insertion, and deletion (free) of the array
and elements inside the array are abstracted into functions, hiding the details
of pointer and memory allocation from the user.

See main.c for a test case.

Test instructions:
- make
- make test

This should compile all files and execute main.

Clean up instructions:
- make clean
