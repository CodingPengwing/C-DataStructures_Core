#Binary Tree#
This is an implementation of a Binary Tree. It contains Nodes which contain pieces of Data.
A Data can technically be anything, as long as the Data files are properly configured. The
current implementation allows a string and a frequency count in a Data, which is used for
frequency counting text documents (ie. bag of words). However, the Data can be altered to
suit the needs of any program that requires a binary tree.
