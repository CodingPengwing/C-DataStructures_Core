An implementation of dynamically managed matrices (or 2d arrays). 
The creation (memory allocation), insertion, and deletion (free) of the matrix,
and elements inside the matrix are abstracted into functions, hiding the details 
of pointer and memory allocation from the user.

See main.c for a test case.

Test instructions:
- make test  

Which is a combination of these 3 commands (you can use these if the first one doesn't work):
- make
- make run_test
- make clean
