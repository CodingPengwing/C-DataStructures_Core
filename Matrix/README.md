An implementation of dynamically managed matrices (or 2d arrays). 
The creation (memory allocation), insertion, and deletion (free) of the matrix,
and elements inside the matrix are abstracted into functions, hiding the details 
of pointer and memory allocation from the user.

See main.c for a test case.

Test instructions:
- make
- make test

This should compile all files and execute main.

Clean up instructions:
- make clean
