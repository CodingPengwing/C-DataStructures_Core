An implementation of dynamically managed arrays. 
The creation (memory allocation), insertion, and deletion (free) of the array
and elements inside the array are abstracted into functions, hiding the details
of pointer and memory allocation from the user.

See main.c for a test case.

Test instructions:
- make test  

Which is a combination of these 3 commands (you can use these if the first one doesn't work):
- make
- make run_test
- make clean
